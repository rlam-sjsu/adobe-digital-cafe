1
00:00:03,636 --> 00:00:07,140
Once we have our

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,608
Road for 2040

3
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:11,945
page in place,
 let's create more screens

4
00:00:12,295 --> 00:00:16,016
for the different options,
 the different sub topics within them.

5
00:00:16,416 --> 00:00:19,769
So I'm going to click on Road to 2040.

6
00:00:22,088 --> 00:00:25,475
I realized that this needed,

7
00:00:25,475 --> 00:00:27,877
a subtitle, so I'm just going to borrow

8
00:00:27,877 --> 00:00:31,681
that from the previous page
 by clicking on it, holding “Alt” or “Option”

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,517
dragging it into my new screen

10
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:38,071
and changing the text for it.

11
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:39,873
Now they have the screen in place.

12
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:43,359
I'm just going to hold “Alt”
 and then copy the whole artboard

13
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,762
by clicking on the name
 and dragging it down.

14
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,265
But this wouldn't be the best function,
 so let's just do “Command + D”

15
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:53,336
or “Control + D”. In this new artboard
 in this new slide,

16
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:57,240
I don't want the icons
 in the exact same manner as before,

17
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,259
so I'm just going to pull that down
 for a bit.

18
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,279
Even the text - pull it up for a bit
 and then just

19
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,150
just duplicate the plain artboard

20
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:11,171
with the menu option and the guidelines.

21
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,339
Now this is to demonstrate

22
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:17,560
another superpower
 that the repeat grid function has, which

23
00:01:19,262 --> 00:01:20,647
is used to create

24
00:01:20,647 --> 00:01:24,267
text in a very symmetric manner

25
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:27,303
across different artboards and across
 different slides.

26
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,390
So what we wanted to do is to zoom out

27
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:34,077
to be able to see the screens
 we want to use

28
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:38,398
and then select the text box
 by holding “Shift”,

29
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,701
click on “Repeat Grid” and

30
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:45,038
drag the controls across the screens.

31
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:48,808
Now we'd like to get
 the spacing of 1920,

32
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,778
which is the width of each screen
 between - 

33
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:54,247
between each text.

34
00:01:54,247 --> 00:01:55,915
But don't worry about that.

35
00:01:55,915 --> 00:01:58,918
That may be a bit difficult
 depending on the size of the text.

36
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:02,222
So let's just keep that keep a spacing

37
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:07,677
so that it's central to each screen
 and then drag in your content

38
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:11,131
that you've written down
 in a .txt file to the header

39
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:14,317
and the subtitle, subtitle body.

40
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:17,403
Now, once we got these in place,

41
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,757
we just need to right
 click on it ungroup.

42
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,526
You can't see the

43
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,681
text on the next slides immediately,
 but don't worry, it's right there.

44
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:33,536
So just ungroup it
 and then you can center each of them.

45
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,540
Do the artboard
 using the align functions at the top

46
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,077
right hand corner.

47
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:49,969
Now we just get super

48
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:55,725
creative and add our bullet points
 along with images to make sure that

49
00:02:56,359 --> 00:02:59,412
the most effective points are conveyed.

50
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:05,018
So these go along with your voice
 and your enthusiasm.

51
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:06,920
So just

52
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:11,057
in case it's a presentation in a web
 site, it would be slightly different.

53
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:13,993
But yeah,
 just make sure you got all your points

54
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:17,313
in there with as many images
 as you think necessary,

55
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,750
and we can do that in many formats.

56
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,436
A really cool place to check out

57
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:27,607
how people give presentations
 is actually just Behance.

58
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:32,111
You can check it out on Behance or go to
 Creative Marketplace, go to Dribble,

59
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:37,150
get some inspiration
 from how people make screens,

60
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:42,455
not just presentations and implement
 whatever is best to you.

61
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:45,425
What you've
 got to remember with the .txt

62
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,128
files is as you press, enter
 or as you create a new line

63
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:53,399
that gets read as a new block of text
 during repeat.

64
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,938
So make sure there aren't any spaces
 in between your -

65
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:00,890
make sure that there aren't

66
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,911
multiple lines in your grid,
 so you can always add them together

67
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:09,465
and then bring it to XD
 and then create multiple lines.

68
00:04:10,483 --> 00:04:12,919
But for now, have it as a single paragraph.

69
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:16,739
And we're

70
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:19,075
almost there guys,
 now we're just going to

71
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:24,430
get our images in place
 and create the icon

72
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,398
buttons.
