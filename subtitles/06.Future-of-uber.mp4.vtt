WEBVTT

00:00:00.383 --> 00:00:01.835
Yep, so we're going to start with

00:00:01.835 --> 00:00:05.822
the future of Uber.
 If we refer back to our wire frame,

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:09.926
we know that there is a short
 brief under each topic.

00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:12.829
So what I did was hold “Alt”

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.232
and then drag down the text.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.153
Because I realized that the 
 “Future of Uber” was actually a component,

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.556
I right click on it
 and then set ungroup component.

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.694
And then let's just format it

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:32.032
to the way we like.
 Have it slightly lighter, more easier

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.801
to read, and center aligned.

00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:39.322
So once I choose a color
 for my secondary text,

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:42.358
I know that it's a color
 that I'll be using again and again.

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.496
So an interesting thing to do is to
 maybe add it your swatches

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:50.333
by clicking on the plus
 button in the color panel.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.805
For the content of the page,

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:57.474
I know that we're going to approximately

00:00:57.474 --> 00:01:00.844
have similar formatting.
 Have the title and subtitle of the page,

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.413
so I select them both while
 holding shift.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.584
Make sure that the title
 is no longer a component,

00:01:07.584 --> 00:01:10.103
by ungrouping component.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:13.423
And then I left align

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.160
both my text boxes
 within the text function

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:22.115
and then left align
 both the text functions to each other.

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:25.735
Now this can be done
 by using the align functions

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:28.822
at the absolute top of your property
 panels.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.342
As I want them both aligned to the left,

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:36.429
I choose the fifth option.

00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:38.782
I also know from our wireframes

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:43.052
that I want these to be bullet points
 that are linked together,

00:01:43.503 --> 00:01:45.722
so let's just add shape next to it.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.291
For that, I'm
 going to choose the rectangle.

00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.794
I could also just press

00:01:50.794 --> 00:01:52.796
“R” on my keyboard.

00:01:54.864 --> 00:01:56.983
Choose the color I want.

00:02:00.253 --> 00:02:03.056
And go back to the repeat grid tool.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:07.844
So just make sure it's in the right
 place, select all my items

00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:10.096
holding shift or dragging over it

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.583
and press on the appropriate function.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.375
I need three bullet points,
 but that would be the spacing required,

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.062
so I'll just make sure
 I've got my spacing checked

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.133
and bring in the elements
 from my folder.

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:35.305
So bring in my .txt files of the header
 to the first header of the group

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:38.274
and the .txt of the first body copy

00:02:38.274 --> 00:02:42.178
to the first body
 copy text box of the group.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:46.099
So to make sure that all
 the bullet points seem connected,

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.154
I'm using the line tool,
 which is on the left hand side toolbar,

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.774
connecting all of them
 and using the properties

00:02:55.325 --> 00:02:58.661
on the right hand tab
 to make it a bit darker.

00:02:58.678 --> 00:03:02.815
Use the colors there
 and increase the thickness of the line.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.886
Now with Importing images,

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:09.973
while we can directly 
 just drag and drop,

00:03:09.973 --> 00:03:14.510
you have to come in and scale it again
 and see how that works.

00:03:14.744 --> 00:03:19.883
So a better habit is to use
 the rectangle to draw the shape

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:25.455
where you want the image to be
 and then drag your image into that box.

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.175
And what this does is gives you a frame.

00:03:29.175 --> 00:03:32.145
And when you double click
 into that frame, you can adjust

00:03:32.512 --> 00:03:34.964
how you want the picture to sit within
 that frame.
