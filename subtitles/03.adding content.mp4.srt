1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,850
For the cover page

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:05,021
would think of having something
 very simple, like a logo in the center,

3
00:00:05,021 --> 00:00:09,209
and the text about your group name,
 and the project name.

4
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:13,113
So let's figure out
 how to bring in assets from the folders

5
00:00:13,113 --> 00:00:14,698
that you guys have created.

6
00:00:14,698 --> 00:00:19,769
So what we're doing here
 is we’ve minimized XD, and then opened up

7
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:23,490
the folder, and just dragged
 in all the assets you wanted.

8
00:00:23,823 --> 00:00:26,910
So we're getting the assets
 for the cover page

9
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,079
and the next few slides
 that we're going to use.

10
00:00:30,397 --> 00:00:31,448
We just saw the Uber

11
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:34,567
logo disappear
 because XD is kind of smart,

12
00:00:34,834 --> 00:00:37,570
and it thought
 that should have been under the cover page.

13
00:00:37,804 --> 00:00:43,076
So what do you got to do is just drag
 your asset outside the cover page to find it

14
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:46,830
and drag it out into general workspace.

15
00:00:47,764 --> 00:00:49,866
Now we're bringing it back in.

16
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:52,018
We want it to be center.

17
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:56,256
You notice
 that XD gives you the guidelines.

18
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:59,909
It makes sure that your asset has centered,
 and you know

19
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,546
which part of the page
 it's presented in.

20
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:08,351
You can resize it
 and then use the text option

21
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:12,672
to add your group name
 and your own names underneath it.

22
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,709
So just click and drag
 where you want your text to be,

23
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,946
and on the right hand side, you see

24
00:01:20,463 --> 00:01:23,967
the property controls for the text box
 that you're going to be writing in.

25
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,670
Now we adjusted the font size

26
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,775
to size 36
 because it's the cover page and chose

27
00:01:31,775 --> 00:01:35,261
the “Uber Moves” font option
 that we had downloaded previously.

28
00:01:36,129 --> 00:01:38,832
We're just entering the text required

29
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,834
and formatting it.

30
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,869
Now if you find it difficult to

31
00:01:43,987 --> 00:01:47,240
control your mouse
 to select things always make sure to hit

32
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:51,628
“V”, which is the select tool
 at the top of the tools table.

33
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:56,099
If you're typing a text,
 it may be a bit difficult to directly

34
00:01:56,099 --> 00:02:00,153
hit the keyboard shortcut “V”
 so we can just do it on the screen or

35
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:04,257
click somewhere outside the box
 and then hit “V”.

36
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:07,627
To select multiple items,

37
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:10,346
just make sure you're
 holding on your shift key

38
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,701
as you select all your items
 you want to move around,

39
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,821
and the thing you can do
 is just drag your mouse

40
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:20,890
over all the elements
 that are required to be selected.

41
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,511
Now, moving on to the menu page,
 we realized

42
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:28,948
actually we like to have a menu button
 that would connect

43
00:02:28,948 --> 00:02:32,585
every other screen back
 to the content space, the menu page.

44
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,221
So we've deleted it for now,

45
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:39,576
to make sure
 that we can have uniformity.

46
00:02:40,143 --> 00:02:42,178
So let's just see how that goes.

47
00:02:42,178 --> 00:02:45,665
So we're just resizing the Uber logo
 to act

48
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:49,169
as our home button,
 bringing it to the top left corner,

49
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,655
kind of feeling out the size,

50
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:55,625
and then for uniformity purpose,

51
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:58,745
select all our content remains
 in the center of the screen.

52
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:03,633
You can just drag your guidelines
 from the corner of an article.

53
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,170
So if you can see on your left hand side
 and the top

54
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:11,524
as you hover the mouse over the edge,
 there's an activity that goes on.

55
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,794
Just click on it
 and drag your guidelines from there.

56
00:03:15,478 --> 00:03:17,797
Now these guidelines will get

57
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,500
duplicated
 in all the slides coming forward,

58
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:24,187
so make sure they're in the right place
 where you want it to be.

59
00:03:24,821 --> 00:03:27,607
Now we're starting off
 with the content of the menu page,

60
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,727
so just giving it a heading - saying menu.

61
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,479
Bringing it back
 to where you'd want it to be.

62
00:03:34,564 --> 00:03:37,417
Then make sure
 you're using the text property tools

63
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:41,621
on the right hand side, and making
 sure it looks like the heading.

64
00:03:41,738 --> 00:03:42,322
Yeah.

65
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:46,442
Now we get into the cool part
 that's kind of unique to XD

66
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:51,547
We’ll be using the repeat grid function,
 which we’ll use multiple times

67
00:03:51,547 --> 00:03:56,219
in this presentation and this workshop
 in a variety of different ways.

68
00:03:57,003 --> 00:03:59,138
Now, make sure that your item is
 selected.

69
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:02,892
Click on Repeat Grid
 and you can drag the bottom

70
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:05,812
green controls so you see your item.

71
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:11,267
Your text box gets repeated
 as many times as the space allows.

72
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,421
And when you hover over the space
 in between two items,

73
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:20,760
you get a pink box
 and just click and drag to adjust

74
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,496
the spacing between the items.

75
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:26,549
This is a super cool function,
 which will get used in multiple

76
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:27,750
different ways.

77
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:31,721
But the reason why we asked you guys

78
00:04:31,888 --> 00:04:36,209
to make sure
 that all your assets are in order

79
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:40,530
is because this option allows you

80
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,833
to populate all the different text boxes

81
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:48,004
with different text by just dragging
 and dropping your file into it.

82
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:51,057
Because we had three lines of text,

83
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,426
three boxes got populated.

84
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:56,279
If you had more,
 make sure to add those by

85
00:04:57,146 --> 00:05:00,717
just dragging down your bottom controls
 for the repeat group.

86
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:05,254
And if there were too many,
 the text starts repeating itself,

87
00:05:05,254 --> 00:05:07,774
so just close it down
 to how many we need.

88
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,644
Once I kind of show up
 with the placement of our objects,

89
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:15,815
right click on it
 and then ungroup your grid

90
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:17,617
just doing

91
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:20,470
some final checking on your compositions

92
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,423
and almost done with the menu page.
