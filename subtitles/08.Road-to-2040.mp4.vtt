00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:07.140
Once we have our

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.608
Road for 2040

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:11.945
page in place,
 let's create more screens

00:00:12.295 --> 00:00:16.016
for the different options,
 the different sub topics within them.

00:00:16.416 --> 00:00:19.769
So I'm going to click on Road to 2040.

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:25.475
I realized that this needed,

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:27.877
a subtitle, so I'm just going to borrow

00:00:27.877 --> 00:00:31.681
that from the previous page
 by clicking on it, holding “Alt” or “Option”

00:00:31.698 --> 00:00:34.517
dragging it into my new screen

00:00:34.784 --> 00:00:38.071
and changing the text for it.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.873
Now they have the screen in place.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:43.359
I'm just going to hold “Alt”
 and then copy the whole artboard

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.762
by clicking on the name
 and dragging it down.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:49.265
But this wouldn't be the best function,
 so let's just do “Command + D”

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.336
or “Control + D”. In this new artboard
 in this new slide,

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:57.240
I don't want the icons
 in the exact same manner as before,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.259
so I'm just going to pull that down
 for a bit.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:03.279
Even the text - pull it up for a bit
 and then just

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:07.150
just duplicate the plain artboard

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.171
with the menu option and the guidelines.

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:13.339
Now this is to demonstrate

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:17.560
another superpower
 that the repeat grid function has, which

00:01:19.262 --> 00:01:20.647
is used to create

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:24.267
text in a very symmetric manner

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:27.303
across different artboards and across
 different slides.

00:01:28.288 --> 00:01:30.390
So what we wanted to do is to zoom out

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.077
to be able to see the screens
 we want to use

00:01:34.527 --> 00:01:38.398
and then select the text box
 by holding “Shift”,

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:41.701
click on “Repeat Grid” and

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.038
drag the controls across the screens.

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:48.808
Now we'd like to get
 the spacing of 1920,

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:51.778
which is the width of each screen
 between - 

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:54.247
between each text.

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:55.915
But don't worry about that.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.918
That may be a bit difficult
 depending on the size of the text.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.222
So let's just keep that keep a spacing

00:02:02.222 --> 00:02:07.677
so that it's central to each screen
 and then drag in your content

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:11.131
that you've written down
 in a .txt file to the header

00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:14.317
and the subtitle, subtitle body.

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:17.403
Now, once we got these in place,

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:20.757
we just need to right
 click on it ungroup.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.526
You can't see the

00:02:25.228 --> 00:02:28.681
text on the next slides immediately,
 but don't worry, it's right there.

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:33.536
So just ungroup it
 and then you can center each of them.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.540
Do the artboard
 using the align functions at the top

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.077
right hand corner.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:49.969
Now we just get super

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:55.725
creative and add our bullet points
 along with images to make sure that

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.412
the most effective points are conveyed.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.018
So these go along with your voice
 and your enthusiasm.

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:06.920
So just

00:03:07.637 --> 00:03:11.057
in case it's a presentation in a web
 site, it would be slightly different.

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:13.993
But yeah,
 just make sure you got all your points

00:03:13.993 --> 00:03:17.313
in there with as many images
 as you think necessary,

00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:20.750
and we can do that in many formats.

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:23.436
A really cool place to check out

00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:27.607
how people give presentations
 is actually just Behance.

00:03:27.974 --> 00:03:32.111
You can check it out on Behance or go to
 Creative Marketplace, go to Dribble,

00:03:32.862 --> 00:03:37.150
get some inspiration
 from how people make screens,

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.455
not just presentations and implement
 whatever is best to you.

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:45.425
What you've
 got to remember with the .txt

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:49.128
files is as you press, enter
 or as you create a new line

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:53.399
that gets read as a new block of text
 during repeat.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.938
So make sure there aren't any spaces
 in between your -

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:00.890
make sure that there aren't

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.911
multiple lines in your grid,
 so you can always add them together

00:04:04.911 --> 00:04:09.465
and then bring it to XD
 and then create multiple lines.

00:04:10.483 --> 00:04:12.919
But for now, have it as a single paragraph.

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:16.739
And we're

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.075
almost there guys,
 now we're just going to

00:04:20.043 --> 00:04:24.430
get our images in place
 and create the icon

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.398
buttons.
