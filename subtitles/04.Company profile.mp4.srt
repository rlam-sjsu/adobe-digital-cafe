1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,986
Now we’re onto creating the
rest of our pages.

2
00:00:03,536 --> 00:00:07,457
So as we learned
 before we select the page

3
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:11,194
we want to duplicate,
 and then “Control + D” or “Command + D”.

4
00:00:12,028 --> 00:00:14,464
But oops, we don't really want

5
00:00:14,464 --> 00:00:17,367
the menu and its items to be duplicated.

6
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:21,454
So we're just going to “Control + Z”
 “Command + Z”, which is undo.

7
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:25,058
And then on the first duplication,

8
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:28,778
let's just remove the content
 and then duplicate that slide.

9
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:33,750
So we've got the menu icon we wanted
 and we've got the guidelines

10
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:36,786
which make sure we maintain uniformity

11
00:00:37,137 --> 00:00:39,989
and create a beautiful visual system.

12
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,878
We brought them back
 to the initial location that they were.

13
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:47,464
So we've got the cover page, menu page,

14
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:52,168
and now finally making sure
 that all our next artboards

15
00:00:52,502 --> 00:00:57,457
have the names that reflect
 what the menu page calls them.

16
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:00,009
Moving on,

17
00:01:00,009 --> 00:01:03,613
we're going to check out another cool
 function of XD.

18
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,232
So these are called components.

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:10,553
You see on the left hand
 panel near the layers panel, the box

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,524
or you can right
 click on it and go to make component.

21
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:18,511
The other option is to go
 “Command or Control + K.”

22
00:01:19,712 --> 00:01:21,397
Let's just check out what it does.

23
00:01:21,397 --> 00:01:23,466
So we select the component,

24
00:01:23,933 --> 00:01:26,886
copy, and paste it into the next artboard.

25
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:28,404
Here we center

26
00:01:28,404 --> 00:01:31,858
it just above the guideline
 so that it becomes the title of the page.

27
00:01:32,459 --> 00:01:35,128
So what's interesting
 now, is if you click

28
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:39,899
on the original component
 and make any changes in it,

29
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:43,319
you see that
 it's reflected in its copies.

30
00:01:43,686 --> 00:01:46,389
So let's say you want to change

31
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:49,642
the name of the slide later on.

32
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:53,580
You just go to the menu page
 and change the main component,

33
00:01:53,913 --> 00:01:57,150
and all of its copies
 will reflect the change.

34
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:04,507
As we
 start designing our company profile,

35
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:09,129
we know from our wire frame
 that we want a timeline

36
00:02:09,579 --> 00:02:11,447
where there's a central line,

37
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:15,135
and then we have elements on the top
 and the bottom.

38
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:20,373
So let's start off by using the tools
 and drawing a line in the center.

39
00:02:21,574 --> 00:02:24,344
Make sure to hold “Shift”
 while drawing the line

40
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:29,716
so that it's perpendicular
 or horizontal, so it will be 90 degrees

41
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:33,253
or zero degrees based on
 whichever side you're closer to.

42
00:02:34,337 --> 00:02:37,307
Let's use
 the properties on the right hand side.

43
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,810
Make sure it's clicked and
 then the property panel is activated.

44
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:46,332
Coming back to use the magical repeat
 grid option.

45
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,735
So we created text blocks.

46
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,821
You got the right kind of setting
 we want.

47
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:53,923
So we've got headings and

48
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:57,510
we've got body text. So create the,

49
00:02:57,527 --> 00:03:00,330
make sure that the heading
 is slightly bolder, slightly bigger.

50
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:04,817
And the next text box,
 which is the body text, is slightly

51
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:06,936
smaller, lighter, easier to use.

52
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:10,924
Even if you have fancy
 text in the heading,

53
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,094
have relatively simple

54
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:18,514
text for the body.
 So use like a Sans Serif,

55
00:03:18,915 --> 00:03:23,236
Works Sans, Open Sans, Sans works well.

56
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,057
So once you have your text
 boxes in place, select

57
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:30,126
both of them and click on repeat grid.

58
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:34,464
This time, instead of the vertical,

59
00:03:34,597 --> 00:03:37,267
we’ll choose
 the horizontal control buttons.

60
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,286
So as we drag it out, we've got

61
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,740
as many as we need.
 I think we need five.

62
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:49,746
So let's stop there and for the heading,
 bring in your heading text file.

63
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:55,585
Just drag it and make sure
 that it is extracted in case

64
00:03:55,585 --> 00:04:00,306
you're using the Uber file as non
 extracted files won't be populated.

65
00:04:01,057 --> 00:04:03,209
So you've got your headings
 and your heading spaces,

66
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:07,864
and then you've got your
 body text and the body box.

67
00:04:09,115 --> 00:04:12,685
So just
 make sure all the body text fits.

68
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:16,522
If you find it difficult
 for the body text

69
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:22,445
to be fitting into the drawn box,
 make sure you use the controls.

70
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:25,498
Here are about restricted height,

71
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:27,083
restricted width,

72
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,902
fixed width, I'm
 sure for different needs.

73
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:32,555
You guys will figure it out
 as you use it,

74
00:04:32,555 --> 00:04:33,806
play with it.

75
00:04:34,707 --> 00:04:36,309
And once we're done,

76
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:39,963
we make sure we just had elements
 we need and ungroup them,

77
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:44,817
and then we move around the text
 so that it's in the right place.

78
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:49,289
Alternating top and bottom,
 and we bring in

79
00:04:50,606 --> 00:04:53,159
the icons, scale it down.

80
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:57,447
You can scale together by making sure
 you select all and then scale them down.

81
00:04:58,114 --> 00:05:00,783
And we've almost got the company
 profiles.

82
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:06,756
It's always a good habit
 to kind of group the icon and the text

83
00:05:06,756 --> 00:05:07,473
related to it.

84
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,076
So when you adjust things around,
 then move together.

85
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,298
It also helps with the alignment
 functions that we’ll learn shortly.
