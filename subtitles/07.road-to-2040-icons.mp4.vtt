00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.651
Let's now get into the last

00:00:01.651 --> 00:00:06.156
and most adventurous
 and advanced frame slash

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:10.160
group of frames,
 group of slides, of this workshop.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.563
So in Roadmap to 2040,
 we want to do something different.

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:19.202
We want to create icons and decks
 that lead to other screens.

00:00:19.436 --> 00:00:20.970
So how do we do that?

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.373
Initially,
 let's just create a rectangle.

00:00:23.373 --> 00:00:25.809
Now, if you see in the corner
 of the rectangles,

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:28.511
inside the box, there are side dots.

00:00:28.678 --> 00:00:32.282
If you click on those dots and drag
 it in.

00:00:32.582 --> 00:00:34.250
It creates curved corners.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.203
Now this gives it a nice,
 modern finished look.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.323
You could also do that on the properties
 panel,

00:00:40.557 --> 00:00:42.876
right above the
 color and the fill option.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:48.415
We're going to format
 it so that it has a thicker background

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.984
and then we have a smaller box inside it

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:54.821
where the icons will fit. Below icons,

00:00:55.338 --> 00:00:59.109
we would like the text
 of what those icons represent.

00:00:59.476 --> 00:01:01.995
So let's just add a text box
 there.

00:01:01.995 --> 00:01:05.682
Now it's super important to make sure
 that we have this idea beforehand,

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:09.753
which is why - just draw rough of sketches
 of what you want.

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:13.573
It becomes much easier
 to do subsequent things

00:01:14.124 --> 00:01:17.544
when you have an idea of what you want.

00:01:17.794 --> 00:01:19.312
Now, make sure they're aligned,

00:01:19.312 --> 00:01:24.534
by dragging my mouse over it
 when it's in the select option

00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:29.189
and then clicking that align function
 at the top right hand corner

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.324
align buttons.

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.111
I’m also
 just gonna format the text button

00:01:35.445 --> 00:01:38.481
and now use the “Repeat Grid” option.

00:01:38.815 --> 00:01:43.403
So this populates not just text,
 but even shapes get repeated.

00:01:57.851 --> 00:01:58.434
Now let's

00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:02.472
say I want to add images
 or icons into those boxes.

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:06.459
It's super important that we know
 which order we want them in.

00:02:06.793 --> 00:02:11.231
So just label them accordingly
 so that when you select all

00:02:11.648 --> 00:02:14.200
and then drag them into the “Repeat

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.203
Grid” function, they just fit perfectly .

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:21.374
Now, for four you may think it's easy
 to do it by hand, but this is possible

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:25.145
even if you, let's say
 you have 40 or 50 options.

00:02:26.262 --> 00:02:29.949
Now, once we tried to add

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:32.468
our text, we noticed that
 there's a slight problem that happens.

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:36.055
This is a common problem,
 which happens very regularly.

00:02:36.072 --> 00:02:38.474
So just click into the first text box.

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:42.462
Yeah, and then go to this fixed

00:02:42.462 --> 00:02:45.014
width text box option, click on that.

00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:49.802
So you decide to which space
 your text box fits

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.539
and there won't be any auto adjusting
 patterns.

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:56.676
Let's drag
 our text in now, and it works perfectly.

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:02.632
Let's get
 back into formatting our pretty boxes.

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:05.952
Because these are buttons,

00:03:06.236 --> 00:03:09.556
or these are clickable, you'd want them
 to hover over the screen a bit.

00:03:09.923 --> 00:03:13.393
So what I'm doing is opening
 the layers panel, making sure

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:17.230
only the rectangle is selected
 and then on the right hand side,

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.149
add a shadow. Now right now
 because it's gray

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:25.521
it may not be very visible,
 but I'm sure that it will come through

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:29.559
once we get our colors in place.

00:03:30.526 --> 00:03:33.263
Now, let's assign
 a different color for each of them here.

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:36.416
So when we try to do that directly,

00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:39.319
we realize that the same color
 gets assigned to all of them.

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:43.423
So what we got to do
 is make sure our formatting for the boxes

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.810
are completed, the set,
 and then we ungroup the grid.

00:03:48.378 --> 00:03:52.665
And then get into formatting each color
 as you format the color,

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.550
Make sure to,

00:03:56.853 --> 00:03:58.655
add the colors, into your

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:01.507
swatches, so that you can use it again
 if it ever pops up.

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:04.594
So you have some sort of uniformity
 and a visual language

00:04:04.594 --> 00:04:07.630
that's getting developed
 along with your storytelling methods.
