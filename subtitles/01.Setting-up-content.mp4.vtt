00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.937
Hi, everyone.
 This is Nikhil and Padmashree.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.541
We are the Adobe student assistants
 from the MLK library,

00:00:08.808 --> 00:00:11.978
and welcome to the
 Adobe XD Basics Workshop.

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:17.901
Today, we're going to work through
 creating a simple yet elegant website,

00:00:17.901 --> 00:00:21.971
which could also work as a presentation,
 or a pitch deck based on

00:00:21.971 --> 00:00:25.875
your required mode of storytelling.
 By learning these tips and tricks

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.728
not only will we all become amateur

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.582
UI UX designers,
 but also be able to put forward

00:00:32.582 --> 00:00:34.184
UI UX designers,
 but also be able to put forward

00:00:34.184 --> 00:00:37.971
your ideas, and visions for products,

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:40.356
and systems in the world.

00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:44.294
For this project,
 we will be making a short presentation

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:46.629
on the business model of Uber.

00:00:48.732 --> 00:00:52.452
So before we get started,
 like any good design product,

00:00:52.786 --> 00:00:56.556
it's extremely important
 to get a set of background work done

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.992
- before getting into our final product.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.078
We start with the research work.

00:01:02.078 --> 00:01:05.498
As we are making short a presentation
 on the business model of Uber,

00:01:05.832 --> 00:01:07.150
we make sure we understand

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.936
the interesting aspects of their 
 past, present, and future.

00:01:10.687 --> 00:01:13.990
Once we have collected our resources,
 we summarize it down

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.228
to the bullet points we want to convey,
 and use it as part of our storyboard.

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:22.449
Now comes the interesting part.
We sketch out in a super rough way,

00:01:22.665 --> 00:01:25.552
what we want
 our final product to look like on paper.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:30.256
It's important not to miss this part,
 as this will give us an anchor

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.727
when diving into the multiple features
 that Adobe XD offers,

00:01:34.994 --> 00:01:37.814
which sometimes can make us

00:01:37.814 --> 00:01:40.400
want to do everything at once,
 and lose our vision.

00:01:40.867 --> 00:01:44.204
What we want to capture here is what

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:48.258
the visual feel of the information
 needs to be like,

00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:52.762
and the flow of information
 so that it makes a coherent story.

00:01:53.713 --> 00:01:54.430
It may take a

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.934
few tries and multiple
 scratched up papers to get through it,

00:01:58.301 --> 00:02:01.488
but trust me, guys, it's worth

00:02:01.871 --> 00:02:04.457
knowing what you're up to
 before you dive deep.

00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:07.610
Once we have our research work
 and structure

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.280
in place, it's time to type out
 our information.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.516
Adobe XD has a super sweet feature

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.203
of being able to drag
 and drop text into its location.

00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:21.908
Hence, it requires
 a little bit of formatting beforehand.

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:25.512
All text needs to be saved in plain

00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:28.398
text or simple text mode.

00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:31.701
So wherever you type out
 your text makes sure your output

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:34.470
is in .txt format.

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:39.125
Another important thing to keep in
 mind is to have your headers

00:02:39.342 --> 00:02:42.011
and body text in separate folders.

00:02:42.312 --> 00:02:45.582
Now these will be formatted differently,

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:47.750
so you would like them
 to be grouped together.

00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:51.087
What do you see being done here is

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:54.858
we're just taking out
 all the headings, putting them together,

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.661
bring the text into a new file.

00:02:59.062 --> 00:03:02.048
And even though we have bullet points,

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:05.001
we'd like to have them as paragraphs

00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:08.571
for Adobe to read them as a single unit.

00:03:08.922 --> 00:03:13.426
So just removing all kinds of enter

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:16.930
or line spacing
 so that we get modular text,

00:03:17.564 --> 00:03:20.466
which can be read as separate
 chunks of information.

00:03:22.418 --> 00:03:23.720
This may seem a bit

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.257
laborious up front,
 but it saves a lot of time later on.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.995
So hopefully you guys can incorporate it
 into your process.

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:36.099
Now we move on to
 how to store the information.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.603
What we want to do
 is make sure that all our assets,

00:03:40.603 --> 00:03:46.042
including the text file, or pictures
 or any videos are in their own folders

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:50.563
and preferably labeled in the order
 in which they appear.

00:03:51.014 --> 00:03:56.302
What Adobe wonderfully does
 is if you have multiple boxes,

00:03:56.302 --> 00:04:01.007
you can drag all these pictures
 and it will populate individual boxes.

00:04:02.508 --> 00:04:04.877
And now,
 we're ready to start on our project.

00:04:05.528 --> 00:04:09.465
If you guys are following along,
 make sure to download all the files

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.320
from the Google Drive and extract them
 onto your local computer.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.323
Only once they're extracted,

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.494
can they be dragged
 and dropped into the Adobe XD files.

00:04:21.878 --> 00:04:25.031
So let's just get a head start on that.

00:04:26.566 --> 00:04:30.470
Once you have all of these done,
 we can make sure we have

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.024
installed to the newest update
 and open it up

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:37.560
so we can start on our project
 in the next video.
