00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.850
For the cover page

00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.021
would think of having something
 very simple, like a logo in the center,

00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:09.209
and the text about your group name,
 and the project name.

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:13.113
So let's figure out
 how to bring in assets from the folders

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.698
that you guys have created.

00:00:14.698 --> 00:00:19.769
So what we're doing here
 is we’ve minimized XD, and then opened up

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:23.490
the folder, and just dragged
 in all the assets you wanted.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.910
So we're getting the assets
 for the cover page

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.079
and the next few slides
 that we're going to use.

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:31.448
We just saw the Uber

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:34.567
logo disappear
 because XD is kind of smart,

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:37.570
and it thought
 that should have been under the cover page.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:43.076
So what do you got to do is just drag
 your asset outside the cover page to find it

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:46.830
and drag it out into general workspace.

00:00:47.764 --> 00:00:49.866
Now we're bringing it back in.

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:52.018
We want it to be center.

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:56.256
You notice
 that XD gives you the guidelines.

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.909
It makes sure that your asset has centered,
 and you know

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.546
which part of the page
 it's presented in.

00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:08.351
You can resize it
 and then use the text option

00:01:08.735 --> 00:01:12.672
to add your group name
 and your own names underneath it.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.709
So just click and drag
 where you want your text to be,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.946
and on the right hand side, you see

00:01:20.463 --> 00:01:23.967
the property controls for the text box
 that you're going to be writing in.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.670
Now we adjusted the font size

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.775
to size 36
 because it's the cover page and chose

00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:35.261
the “Uber Moves” font option
 that we had downloaded previously.

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:38.832
We're just entering the text required

00:01:38.832 --> 00:01:40.834
and formatting it.

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:42.869
Now if you find it difficult to

00:01:43.987 --> 00:01:47.240
control your mouse
 to select things always make sure to hit

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.628
“V”, which is the select tool
 at the top of the tools table.

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:56.099
If you're typing a text,
 it may be a bit difficult to directly

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:00.153
hit the keyboard shortcut “V”
 so we can just do it on the screen or

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.257
click somewhere outside the box
 and then hit “V”.

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:07.627
To select multiple items,

00:02:07.627 --> 00:02:10.346
just make sure you're
 holding on your shift key

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.701
as you select all your items
 you want to move around,

00:02:15.101 --> 00:02:17.821
and the thing you can do
 is just drag your mouse

00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:20.890
over all the elements
 that are required to be selected.

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:24.511
Now, moving on to the menu page,
 we realized

00:02:24.761 --> 00:02:28.948
actually we like to have a menu button
 that would connect

00:02:28.948 --> 00:02:32.585
every other screen back
 to the content space, the menu page.

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.221
So we've deleted it for now,

00:02:35.622 --> 00:02:39.576
to make sure
 that we can have uniformity.

00:02:40.143 --> 00:02:42.178
So let's just see how that goes.

00:02:42.178 --> 00:02:45.665
So we're just resizing the Uber logo
 to act

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:49.169
as our home button,
 bringing it to the top left corner,

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.655
kind of feeling out the size,

00:02:52.655 --> 00:02:55.625
and then for uniformity purpose,

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:58.745
select all our content remains
 in the center of the screen.

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:03.633
You can just drag your guidelines
 from the corner of an article.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.170
So if you can see on your left hand side
 and the top

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.524
as you hover the mouse over the edge,
 there's an activity that goes on.

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:14.794
Just click on it
 and drag your guidelines from there.

00:03:15.478 --> 00:03:17.797
Now these guidelines will get

00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:20.500
duplicated
 in all the slides coming forward,

00:03:20.817 --> 00:03:24.187
so make sure they're in the right place
 where you want it to be.

00:03:24.821 --> 00:03:27.607
Now we're starting off
 with the content of the menu page,

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:30.727
so just giving it a heading - saying menu.

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:33.479
Bringing it back
 to where you'd want it to be.

00:03:34.564 --> 00:03:37.417
Then make sure
 you're using the text property tools

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:41.621
on the right hand side, and making
 sure it looks like the heading.

00:03:41.738 --> 00:03:42.322
Yeah.

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.442
Now we get into the cool part
 that's kind of unique to XD

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:51.547
We’ll be using the repeat grid function,
 which we’ll use multiple times

00:03:51.547 --> 00:03:56.219
in this presentation and this workshop
 in a variety of different ways.

00:03:57.003 --> 00:03:59.138
Now, make sure that your item is
 selected.

00:03:59.138 --> 00:04:02.892
Click on Repeat Grid
 and you can drag the bottom

00:04:02.892 --> 00:04:05.812
green controls so you see your item.

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:11.267
Your text box gets repeated
 as many times as the space allows.

00:04:11.584 --> 00:04:15.421
And when you hover over the space
 in between two items,

00:04:15.655 --> 00:04:20.760
you get a pink box
 and just click and drag to adjust

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.496
the spacing between the items.

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:26.549
This is a super cool function,
 which will get used in multiple

00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:27.750
different ways.

00:04:28.001 --> 00:04:31.721
But the reason why we asked you guys

00:04:31.888 --> 00:04:36.209
to make sure
 that all your assets are in order

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:40.530
is because this option allows you

00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:43.833
to populate all the different text boxes

00:04:44.133 --> 00:04:48.004
with different text by just dragging
 and dropping your file into it.

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:51.057
Because we had three lines of text,

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:53.426
three boxes got populated.

00:04:53.426 --> 00:04:56.279
If you had more,
 make sure to add those by

00:04:57.146 --> 00:05:00.717
just dragging down your bottom controls
 for the repeat group.

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:05.254
And if there were too many,
 the text starts repeating itself,

00:05:05.254 --> 00:05:07.774
so just close it down
 to how many we need.

00:05:08.441 --> 00:05:11.644
Once I kind of show up
 with the placement of our objects,

00:05:12.362 --> 00:05:15.815
right click on it
 and then ungroup your grid

00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:17.617
just doing

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:20.470
some final checking on your compositions

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.423
and almost done with the menu page.
