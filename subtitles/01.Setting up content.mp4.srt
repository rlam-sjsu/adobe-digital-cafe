Hi, everyone.
 This is Nikhil and Padmashree.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,541
We are the Adobe student assistants
 from the MLK library,

3
00:00:08,808 --> 00:00:11,978
and welcome to the
 Adobe XD Basics Workshop.

4
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:17,901
Today, we're going to work through
 creating a simple yet elegant website,

5
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:21,971
which could also work as a presentation,
 or a pitch deck based on

6
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:25,875
your required mode of storytelling.
 By learning these tips and tricks

7
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:28,728
not only will we all become amateur

8
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:32,582
UI UX designers,
 but also be able to put forward

9
00:00:32,582 --> 00:00:34,184
UI UX designers,
 but also be able to put forward

10
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:37,971
your ideas, and visions for products,

11
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,356
and systems in the world.

12
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:44,294
For this project,
 we will be making a short presentation

13
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:46,629
on the business model of Uber.

14
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:52,452
So before we get started,
 like any good design product,

15
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:56,556
it's extremely important
 to get a set of background work done

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,992
- before getting into our final product.

17
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,078
We start with the research work.

18
00:01:02,078 --> 00:01:05,498
As we are making short a presentation
 on the business model of Uber,

19
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,150
we make sure we understand

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,936
the interesting aspects of their 
 past, present, and future.

21
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:13,990
Once we have collected our resources,
 we summarize it down

22
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,228
to the bullet points we want to convey,
 and use it as part of our storyboard.

23
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:22,449
Now comes the interesting part.
We sketch out in a super rough way,

24
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,552
what we want
 our final product to look like on paper.

25
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:30,256
It's important not to miss this part,
 as this will give us an anchor

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:34,727
when diving into the multiple features
 that Adobe XD offers,

27
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:37,814
which sometimes can make us

28
00:01:37,814 --> 00:01:40,400
want to do everything at once,
 and lose our vision.

29
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:44,204
What we want to capture here is what

30
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:48,258
the visual feel of the information
 needs to be like,

31
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:52,762
and the flow of information
 so that it makes a coherent story.

32
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:54,430
It may take a

33
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,934
few tries and multiple
 scratched up papers to get through it,

34
00:01:58,301 --> 00:02:01,488
but trust me, guys, it's worth

35
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,457
knowing what you're up to
 before you dive deep.

36
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:07,610
Once we have our research work
 and structure

37
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,280
in place, it's time to type out
 our information.

38
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:13,516
Adobe XD has a super sweet feature

39
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,203
of being able to drag
 and drop text into its location.

40
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:21,908
Hence, it requires
 a little bit of formatting beforehand.

41
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:25,512
All text needs to be saved in plain

42
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:28,398
text or simple text mode.

43
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:31,701
So wherever you type out
 your text makes sure your output

44
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:34,470
is in .txt format.

45
00:02:35,505 --> 00:02:39,125
Another important thing to keep in
 mind is to have your headers

46
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:42,011
and body text in separate folders.

47
00:02:42,312 --> 00:02:45,582
Now these will be formatted differently,

48
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,750
so you would like them
 to be grouped together.

49
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:51,087
What do you see being done here is

50
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:54,858
we're just taking out
 all the headings, putting them together,

51
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,661
bring the text into a new file.

52
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:02,048
And even though we have bullet points,

53
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,001
we'd like to have them as paragraphs

54
00:03:05,301 --> 00:03:08,571
for Adobe to read them as a single unit.

55
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:13,426
So just removing all kinds of enter

56
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:16,930
or line spacing
 so that we get modular text,

57
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:20,466
which can be read as separate
 chunks of information.

58
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:23,720
This may seem a bit

59
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,257
laborious up front,
 but it saves a lot of time later on.

60
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,995
So hopefully you guys can incorporate it
 into your process.

61
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:36,099
Now we move on to
 how to store the information.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,603
What we want to do
 is make sure that all our assets,

63
00:03:40,603 --> 00:03:46,042
including the text file, or pictures
 or any videos are in their own folders

64
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:50,563
and preferably labeled in the order
 in which they appear.

65
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:56,302
What Adobe wonderfully does
 is if you have multiple boxes,

66
00:03:56,302 --> 00:04:01,007
you can drag all these pictures
 and it will populate individual boxes.

67
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:04,877
And now,
 we're ready to start on our project.

68
00:04:05,528 --> 00:04:09,465
If you guys are following along,
 make sure to download all the files

69
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:14,320
from the Google Drive and extract them
 onto your local computer.

70
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,323
Only once they're extracted,

71
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:21,494
can they be dragged
 and dropped into the Adobe XD files.

72
00:04:21,878 --> 00:04:25,031
So let's just get a head start on that.

73
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:30,470
Once you have all of these done,
 we can make sure we have

74
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,024
installed to the newest update
 and open it up

75
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:37,560
so we can start on our project
 in the next video.
