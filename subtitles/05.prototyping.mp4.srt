1
00:00:01,151 --> 00:00:01,735
We're now going to

2
00:00:01,735 --> 00:00:04,604
learn about the prototyping function of XD.

3
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:08,725
This is what makes any kind of UI / UX

4
00:00:09,893 --> 00:00:11,695
software special.

5
00:00:11,695 --> 00:00:14,981
It makes sure
 that our sense of storytelling

6
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,183
is more than just linear, right?

7
00:00:17,183 --> 00:00:18,251
And we can move around.

8
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,054
We can click around,
 have parallel story lines running.

9
00:00:21,805 --> 00:00:25,341
For this, we need to make sure
 that we're in the prototype window.

10
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:27,644
You can find this

11
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,196
after the design window

12
00:00:30,647 --> 00:00:33,383
at the top left corner of your screen.

13
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:37,821
Now, the prototyping window
 is used to make sure

14
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:41,024
that all the links and connections
 between different elements

15
00:00:41,324 --> 00:00:46,696
in the slide deck or in the presentation
 in the website is created.

16
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:50,834
How we do this is by clicking
 on the element that we want to link,

17
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:54,254
and you can see
 on the right side of the element.

18
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,057
You get a blue arrow mark.

19
00:00:57,057 --> 00:01:01,044
When we click and drag the blue arrow mark.

20
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,664
You see a link, a connection, an arrow being made.

21
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:08,418
Now this can be either
 an element to a page

22
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,054
or even a whole page to a page.

23
00:01:11,054 --> 00:01:11,888
So if you want

24
00:01:12,972 --> 00:01:15,792
anyone to click anywhere on the page
 and it goes to the next page,

25
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,311
make sure you click the artboard

26
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:23,333
and the artboard gets a small arrow marked
 link that to the next dartboard.

27
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,603
We made sure that all our menu

28
00:01:26,603 --> 00:01:29,155
icons link back to the menu page

29
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:33,893
and all the elements of the menu,
 link to the slides.

30
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:38,815
At this point, Nikhil
 shared the document with me, Padmashree.

31
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:43,403
So he just went to the share option up
 there and added -

32
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,439
invited me to edit.

33
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:48,725
So when you work in groups,
 this helps a lot.

34
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,613
So on my end, when I received
 the invitation, I just make sure

35
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,432
I went to Creative Cloud notifications

36
00:01:56,766 --> 00:01:59,035
and clicked on the latest notification

37
00:02:00,003 --> 00:02:02,405
Let's let it load

38
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,625
I'm the new teammate
 and owner of the file.
