00:00:01.151 --> 00:00:01.735
We're now going to

00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:04.604
learn about the prototyping function of XD.

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:08.725
This is what makes any kind of UI / UX

00:00:09.893 --> 00:00:11.695
software special.

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:14.981
It makes sure
 that our sense of storytelling

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.183
is more than just linear, right?

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:18.251
And we can move around.

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:21.054
We can click around,
 have parallel story lines running.

00:00:21.805 --> 00:00:25.341
For this, we need to make sure
 that we're in the prototype window.

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:27.644
You can find this

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.196
after the design window

00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:33.383
at the top left corner of your screen.

00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:37.821
Now, the prototyping window
 is used to make sure

00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:41.024
that all the links and connections
 between different elements

00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:46.696
in the slide deck or in the presentation
 in the website is created.

00:00:47.147 --> 00:00:50.834
How we do this is by clicking
 on the element that we want to link,

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:54.254
and you can see
 on the right side of the element.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:57.057
You get a blue arrow mark.

00:00:57.057 --> 00:01:01.044
When we click and drag the blue arrow mark.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:04.664
You see a link, a connection, an arrow being made.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:08.418
Now this can be either
 an element to a page

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:11.054
or even a whole page to a page.

00:01:11.054 --> 00:01:11.888
So if you want

00:01:12.972 --> 00:01:15.792
anyone to click anywhere on the page
 and it goes to the next page,

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.311
make sure you click the artboard

00:01:18.745 --> 00:01:23.333
and the artboard gets a small arrow marked
 link that to the next dartboard.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.603
We made sure that all our menu

00:01:26.603 --> 00:01:29.155
icons link back to the menu page

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:33.893
and all the elements of the menu,
 link to the slides.

00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:38.815
At this point, Nikhil
 shared the document with me, Padmashree.

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:43.403
So he just went to the share option up
 there and added -

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.439
invited me to edit.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.725
So when you work in groups,
 this helps a lot.

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.613
So on my end, when I received
 the invitation, I just make sure

00:01:53.613 --> 00:01:56.432
I went to Creative Cloud notifications

00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.035
and clicked on the latest notification

00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:02.405
Let's let it load

00:02:02.872 --> 00:02:05.625
I'm the new teammate
 and owner of the file.
