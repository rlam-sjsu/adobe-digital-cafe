1
00:00:00,383 --> 00:00:01,835
Yep, so we're going to start with

2
00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:05,822
the future of Uber.
 If we refer back to our wire frame,

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:09,926
we know that there is a short
 brief under each topic.

4
00:00:10,226 --> 00:00:12,829
So what I did was hold “Alt”

5
00:00:13,079 --> 00:00:16,232
and then drag down the text.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,153
Because I realized that the 
 “Future of Uber” was actually a component,

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,556
I right click on it
 and then set ungroup component.

8
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:27,694
And then let's just format it

9
00:00:27,927 --> 00:00:32,032
to the way we like.
 Have it slightly lighter, more easier

10
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,801
to read, and center aligned.

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:39,322
So once I choose a color
 for my secondary text,

12
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:42,358
I know that it's a color
 that I'll be using again and again.

13
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,496
So an interesting thing to do is to
 maybe add it your swatches

14
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:50,333
by clicking on the plus
 button in the color panel.

15
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,805
For the content of the page,

16
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,474
I know that we're going to approximately

17
00:00:57,474 --> 00:01:00,844
have similar formatting.
 Have the title and subtitle of the page,

18
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:03,413
so I select them both while
 holding shift.

19
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,584
Make sure that the title
 is no longer a component,

20
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:10,103
by ungrouping component.

21
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,423
And then I left align

22
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,160
both my text boxes
 within the text function

23
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:22,115
and then left align
 both the text functions to each other.

24
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:25,735
Now this can be done
 by using the align functions

25
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:28,822
at the absolute top of your property
 panels.

26
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,342
As I want them both aligned to the left,

27
00:01:32,642 --> 00:01:36,429
I choose the fifth option.

28
00:01:36,713 --> 00:01:38,782
I also know from our wireframes

29
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:43,052
that I want these to be bullet points
 that are linked together,

30
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,722
so let's just add shape next to it.

31
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,291
For that, I'm
 going to choose the rectangle.

32
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,794
I could also just press

33
00:01:50,794 --> 00:01:52,796
“R” on my keyboard.

34
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,983
Choose the color I want.

35
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:03,056
And go back to the repeat grid tool.

36
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:07,844
So just make sure it's in the right
 place, select all my items

37
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:10,096
holding shift or dragging over it

38
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,583
and press on the appropriate function.

39
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:22,375
I need three bullet points,
 but that would be the spacing required,

40
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,062
so I'll just make sure
 I've got my spacing checked

41
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,133
and bring in the elements
 from my folder.

42
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:35,305
So bring in my .txt files of the header
 to the first header of the group

43
00:02:35,788 --> 00:02:38,274
and the .txt of the first body copy

44
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:42,178
to the first body
 copy text box of the group.

45
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,099
So to make sure that all
 the bullet points seem connected,

46
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:51,154
I'm using the line tool,
 which is on the left hand side toolbar,

47
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,774
connecting all of them
 and using the properties

48
00:02:55,325 --> 00:02:58,661
on the right hand tab
 to make it a bit darker.

49
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:02,815
Use the colors there
 and increase the thickness of the line.

50
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:06,886
Now with Importing images,

51
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:09,973
while we can directly 
 just drag and drop,

52
00:03:09,973 --> 00:03:14,510
you have to come in and scale it again
 and see how that works.

53
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:19,883
So a better habit is to use
 the rectangle to draw the shape

54
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:25,455
where you want the image to be
 and then drag your image into that box.

55
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,175
And what this does is gives you a frame.

56
00:03:29,175 --> 00:03:32,145
And when you double click
 into that frame, you can adjust

57
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,964
how you want the picture to sit within
 that frame.
