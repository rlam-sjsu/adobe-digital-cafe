1
00:00:01,768 --> 00:00:02,185
Creating

2
00:00:02,185 --> 00:00:07,307
the icons or clickable elements is part
 of the magic of components.

3
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,577
Now this is slightly advanced and

4
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:12,228
you don't have to worry about it

5
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:15,849
immediately,
 but it's nice to have when you have XD.

6
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,835
So this is a bit more than beginners.

7
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,021
This is intermediate.

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,941
So what you want is just the images
 and the colors of the boxes.

9
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,377
So we're just going to click into

10
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,097
the groups,
 by holding down control or command.

11
00:00:31,648 --> 00:00:36,770
So that lets us select
 the options directly of a group.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:42,375
Or we can just select them from the layers
 panel as I do rectangles.

13
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:46,796
Now we all want them to be
 slightly smaller, so they can be part of

14
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:47,881
the screen.

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:52,135
Let's just bring it down
 to 120 “Width” and “Height”

16
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,555
and now select the images

17
00:00:55,855 --> 00:01:00,226
and bring them on top of the rectangle,
 so that they sit in-between.

18
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:04,948
Now we immediately see the problem that
 we can't see their backgrounds behind,

19
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:11,121
which is why we use the magic
 of “Layer Styles”. Now Layer Styles,

20
00:01:11,454 --> 00:01:15,141
essentially,
 lets us choose how an image

21
00:01:15,141 --> 00:01:18,411
or a layer interacts
 with its background.

22
00:01:19,345 --> 00:01:23,416
If we choose multiply,
 only to darker aspects of the image

23
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:25,368
show.

24
00:01:25,368 --> 00:01:29,489
So here the darkest aspect
 being the icon itself,

25
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:32,609
the white disappears.

26
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:34,828
And after we've come to this point,

27
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:38,932
let's just try to rearrange it bit
 make sure that the images

28
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:44,921
are center of the box,
 We can either do it by eye measurement,

29
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:47,307
the guidelines, or use align functions.

30
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:52,579
After that, get - make sure that they
 appear in the right place on the screen,

31
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:56,116
because this is a repeating element
 that we'll use again and again.

32
00:01:56,633 --> 00:02:01,321
I feel like the border is a bit too
 thick, so going to reduce that a bit,

33
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:05,758
and maybe
 even reduce the intensity of the shadows,

34
00:02:06,109 --> 00:02:08,761
and looks good. At this point,

35
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,931
we make the icons into a component.

36
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:15,919
Now this is super important to create
 some kind of reaction to the clicking.

37
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:20,907
So let's select all aspects of the image
 and the background,

38
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:23,960
and click on component
 on the right hand side

39
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,413
- or “Command / Control + K”. Just right

40
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:30,767
Click on it
 and find “Make Component” order.

41
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,343
We're gonna quickly
 go into the prototype window

42
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,429
and make sure all the icons are linked

43
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:48,918
to the respective pages. Now
 because they’re components, when we copy

44
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:53,122
paste these into the next sheet,

45
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,776
they retain their connections.

46
00:02:59,996 --> 00:03:02,999
So what I'm going to do now
 is go back to the design screen,

47
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,985
select all of them, “Control + C”

48
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,988
and “Control + V” into the next sheet.

49
00:03:09,672 --> 00:03:10,290
Right.

50
00:03:10,306 --> 00:03:13,826
So we see, except for the first one,

51
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,480
all of them are already linked to
 which screen that's supposed to go to.

52
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:21,467
So we'll just quickly select
 the first option, the leaf

53
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:25,972
and connect it back to the screen
 it's supposed to go to

54
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,657
when clicked upon.

55
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:33,012
Now we've got an awesome

56
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,366
animation creation,
 So you want it to react,

57
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:40,119
you want to give the person feedback
 that it has been clicked upon.

58
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:45,308
So what we do is we work with states,
 so click on the component.

59
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:49,429
And on the right hand side
 where we added it as a component,

60
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:52,982
click on the plus button
 and go to toggle state.

61
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:56,185
So toggle state
 is what happens when you click on it.

62
00:03:56,953 --> 00:04:01,107
Let's edit the component
 while it's still in the toggle state.

63
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:06,763
So just keep an eye that is in
 the toggle state in the component panel.

64
00:04:08,298 --> 00:04:09,065
Now what we're going to

65
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:11,301
do is click into the component

66
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:15,305
instead of a shadow,
 give it an inner shadow.

67
00:04:15,738 --> 00:04:17,991
So instead of drop shadow,
 it's an inner shadow.

68
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:22,378
And then maybe you could change
 the background so that it's a lighter

69
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,646
green,

70
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:27,967
even reduce the capacity of the image.

71
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,285
So it looks a bit pressed.

72
00:04:29,285 --> 00:04:32,505
It's - it's used,

73
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,791
and now we've got a button.

74
00:04:36,309 --> 00:04:38,745
So if you go back, I'll zoom out

75
00:04:39,128 --> 00:04:42,398
and click outside, click
 back in in the component.

76
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:45,885
Try seeing it in the toggle state, non toggle

77
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,705
state, toggle state, default state.

78
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,124
It looks good.

79
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,775
Awesome.

80
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:55,962
Now this is something you could repeat
 on the other buttons.

81
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,865
But for now,
 let's just go back to the preview.

82
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:02,001
Check out how we're doing.

83
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:04,937
So that's the preview - the play button.

84
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,790
We start with our call page.

85
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,727
Click anywhere to go into menu.

86
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,480
Let's just click on Future of Uber.
 That’s a clean page.

87
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,451
Click Anywhere Again to go
 into the next page, which is Road Map.

88
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:21,521
Now we haven't yet completed this,
 but let's click

89
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:25,358
on first Button,
 and that's great animation.

90
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,030
So it leads to its own page.

91
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:34,500
Just a little bit
 more hard work, and work done.

92
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:39,055
And here's is the final product, guys.

93
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,491
I'm sure all of yours look so cool.

94
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:44,660
I’ll be excited to see it again.

95
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:49,615
Clicking on your option,
 going to your company

96
00:05:49,615 --> 00:05:51,050
profile,

97
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:54,370
the future of your company.

98
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,339
Use hover states.

99
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:02,028
Just try it out and clickable buttons. Yay.
