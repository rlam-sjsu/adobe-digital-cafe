1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,102
Before we get into the tutorial,

2
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:04,270
let's just go through the slides
 we're going to create

3
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,239
for Uber.

4
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:08,892
We've got a cover page,

5
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:11,077
a menu, and a few slides of content.

6
00:00:12,228 --> 00:00:17,384
What we see here is a clean cover page,
 with just a logo and some text on it.

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,586
The menu page

8
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:22,856
has the major topics that we're going
 to be covering in the presentation,

9
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:26,743
which when clicked upon,
 take us to the respective slides.

10
00:00:28,395 --> 00:00:30,730
Our first content slide is the company
 profile,

11
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,968
where we've created the timeline
 of the company's existence.

12
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,821
As this is just a short tutorial,

13
00:00:38,388 --> 00:00:41,474
the second page jumps
 directly into the future of Uber,

14
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:45,712
elaborating on the company's
 plans for their future.

15
00:00:46,396 --> 00:00:49,365
I'm sure you guys
 will have many more slides in between.

16
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:54,370
But here the last topic we cover,
 is the Roadmap to 2040.

17
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,541
Here, we have more sub topics
 which, when clicked upon

18
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,761
elaborate on each subheading.

19
00:01:03,012 --> 00:01:07,967
A slightly advanced thing we touch upon
 is to create responsive buttons

20
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:11,387
so pages
 can be linked within each other.

21
00:01:12,355 --> 00:01:15,125
Now that we know what we're up
 to, let's get right into it.

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,811
As soon as we open

23
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,464
Adobe XD, we land in the startup menu.

24
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:24,951
Here we have an option to choose
 from their layouts,

25
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,821
or open a preexisting saved file.

26
00:01:28,571 --> 00:01:31,758
For the purpose of this recording,
 let's choose the web layout

27
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:36,312
with 1920x1080 resolution.

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,133
If you guys are used
 any Adobe product before,

29
00:01:40,884 --> 00:01:45,588
we should land on a similar layout
 with all our tools on the left hand side

30
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,408
and the property menus
 on the right hand side

31
00:01:48,792 --> 00:01:51,227
with our working space in the center.

32
00:01:52,011 --> 00:01:53,113
What we see here

33
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,633
is the first page of our website,
 or slide deck known as the artboard.

34
00:01:56,983 --> 00:02:01,121
Now you can change the color
 of the artboard by the fill option here,

35
00:02:01,304 --> 00:02:03,640
which sets the tone
 for your presentation.

36
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:08,928
As we're working on Uber, which works
 basically with white and black,

37
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,582
we're going to keep it a minimal
 white background.

38
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:16,102
What's really important
 here is to make sure to label

39
00:02:16,102 --> 00:02:19,189
your artboards
 as we create multiple slides.

40
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:24,410
It's important that we keep track
 of which slide goes off to which,

41
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:28,414
for which you can either
 double click on the name

42
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:33,219
right above the artboard
 or change it in the layers panel.

43
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,256
At this point,
 we'd like to create multiple artboards

44
00:02:36,256 --> 00:02:37,874
to work on simultaneously.

45
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:41,928
Now, if you have some layout
 and formatting done on the first artboard,

46
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:47,350
it's best to use the “command D” or 
 “control D” function to duplicate your artboards.

47
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:50,386
Since we have

48
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:54,174
three different pages
 apart from the menu page

49
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:57,076
and the color page,
 we're going to duplicate it five times.

50
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,979
You can figure out the number of slides

51
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:03,116
you need,
 by referring to your initial wireframes sketches.

52
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,103
Another way of doing this
 is to go to your artboard option

53
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:12,041
on your left hand side and then choose
 the size of the artboard we need next,

54
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,228
when the formatting of the next slide

55
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,897
is totally different from the first one.

56
00:03:18,798 --> 00:03:21,851
Another sneaky method you can use,
 is to always click

57
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:26,739
on the name of the artboard,
 and then hold “alt” or “option”

58
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,776
and drag the artboard to the place
 you want it to be.

59
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,028
For visual clarity,

60
00:03:32,028 --> 00:03:34,731
let’s just select the artboard’s - 

61
00:03:34,731 --> 00:03:38,902
the last three of them and drag them below.
 So we've got the cover, the menu,

62
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,804
and then the main slides.

63
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:44,140
Let's also get onto renaming them
 quickly,

64
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:46,926
before you move on to the next steps.
