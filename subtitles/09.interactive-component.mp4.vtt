00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:02.185
Creating

00:00:02.185 --> 00:00:07.307
the icons or clickable elements is part
 of the magic of components.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.577
Now this is slightly advanced and

00:00:10.577 --> 00:00:12.228
you don't have to worry about it

00:00:12.228 --> 00:00:15.849
immediately,
 but it's nice to have when you have XD.

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:18.835
So this is a bit more than beginners.

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.021
This is intermediate.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:24.941
So what you want is just the images
 and the colors of the boxes.

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.377
So we're just going to click into

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.097
the groups,
 by holding down control or command.

00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:36.770
So that lets us select
 the options directly of a group.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.375
Or we can just select them from the layers
 panel as I do rectangles.

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:46.796
Now we all want them to be
 slightly smaller, so they can be part of

00:00:46.796 --> 00:00:47.881
the screen.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:52.135
Let's just bring it down
 to 120 “Width” and “Height”

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.555
and now select the images

00:00:55.855 --> 00:01:00.226
and bring them on top of the rectangle,
 so that they sit in-between.

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:04.948
Now we immediately see the problem that
 we can't see their backgrounds behind,

00:01:05.398 --> 00:01:11.121
which is why we use the magic
 of “Layer Styles”. Now Layer Styles,

00:01:11.454 --> 00:01:15.141
essentially,
 lets us choose how an image

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:18.411
or a layer interacts
 with its background.

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:23.416
If we choose multiply,
 only to darker aspects of the image

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:25.368
show.

00:01:25.368 --> 00:01:29.489
So here the darkest aspect
 being the icon itself,

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:32.609
the white disappears.

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:34.828
And after we've come to this point,

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:38.932
let's just try to rearrange it bit
 make sure that the images

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.921
are center of the box,
 We can either do it by eye measurement,

00:01:44.938 --> 00:01:47.307
the guidelines, or use align functions.

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:52.579
After that, get - make sure that they
 appear in the right place on the screen,

00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:56.116
because this is a repeating element
 that we'll use again and again.

00:01:56.633 --> 00:02:01.321
I feel like the border is a bit too
 thick, so going to reduce that a bit,

00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:05.758
and maybe
 even reduce the intensity of the shadows,

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.761
and looks good. At this point,

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.931
we make the icons into a component.

00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:15.919
Now this is super important to create
 some kind of reaction to the clicking.

00:02:16.252 --> 00:02:20.907
So let's select all aspects of the image
 and the background,

00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:23.960
and click on component
 on the right hand side

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.413
- or “Command / Control + K”. Just right

00:02:27.413 --> 00:02:30.767
Click on it
 and find “Make Component” order.

00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:40.343
We're gonna quickly
 go into the prototype window

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.429
and make sure all the icons are linked

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:48.918
to the respective pages. Now
 because they’re components, when we copy

00:02:48.918 --> 00:02:53.122
paste these into the next sheet,

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.776
they retain their connections.

00:02:59.996 --> 00:03:02.999
So what I'm going to do now
 is go back to the design screen,

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.985
select all of them, “Control + C”

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:08.988
and “Control + V” into the next sheet.

00:03:09.672 --> 00:03:10.290
Right.

00:03:10.306 --> 00:03:13.826
So we see, except for the first one,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.480
all of them are already linked to
 which screen that's supposed to go to.

00:03:18.081 --> 00:03:21.467
So we'll just quickly select
 the first option, the leaf

00:03:21.885 --> 00:03:25.972
and connect it back to the screen
 it's supposed to go to

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:27.657
when clicked upon.

00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:33.012
Now we've got an awesome

00:03:33.012 --> 00:03:36.366
animation creation,
 So you want it to react,

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:40.119
you want to give the person feedback
 that it has been clicked upon.

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:45.308
So what we do is we work with states,
 so click on the component.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:49.429
And on the right hand side
 where we added it as a component,

00:03:49.812 --> 00:03:52.982
click on the plus button
 and go to toggle state.

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:56.185
So toggle state
 is what happens when you click on it.

00:03:56.953 --> 00:04:01.107
Let's edit the component
 while it's still in the toggle state.

00:04:01.491 --> 00:04:06.763
So just keep an eye that is in
 the toggle state in the component panel.

00:04:08.298 --> 00:04:09.065
Now what we're going to

00:04:09.065 --> 00:04:11.301
do is click into the component

00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:15.305
instead of a shadow,
 give it an inner shadow.

00:04:15.738 --> 00:04:17.991
So instead of drop shadow,
 it's an inner shadow.

00:04:18.374 --> 00:04:22.378
And then maybe you could change
 the background so that it's a lighter

00:04:22.395 --> 00:04:23.646
green,

00:04:24.314 --> 00:04:27.967
even reduce the capacity of the image.

00:04:27.967 --> 00:04:29.285
So it looks a bit pressed.

00:04:29.285 --> 00:04:32.505
It's - it's used,

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:34.791
and now we've got a button.

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:38.745
So if you go back, I'll zoom out

00:04:39.128 --> 00:04:42.398
and click outside, click
 back in in the component.

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:45.885
Try seeing it in the toggle state, non toggle

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:48.705
state, toggle state, default state.

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:51.124
It looks good.

00:04:51.708 --> 00:04:52.775
Awesome.

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:55.962
Now this is something you could repeat
 on the other buttons.

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:58.865
But for now,
 let's just go back to the preview.

00:04:59.499 --> 00:05:02.001
Check out how we're doing.

00:05:02.001 --> 00:05:04.937
So that's the preview - the play button.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.790
We start with our call page.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:10.727
Click anywhere to go into menu.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.480
Let's just click on Future of Uber.
 That’s a clean page.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.451
Click Anywhere Again to go
 into the next page, which is Road Map.

00:05:18.518 --> 00:05:21.521
Now we haven't yet completed this,
 but let's click

00:05:21.521 --> 00:05:25.358
on first Button,
 and that's great animation.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.030
So it leads to its own page.

00:05:31.597 --> 00:05:34.500
Just a little bit
 more hard work, and work done.

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:39.055
And here's is the final product, guys.

00:05:39.455 --> 00:05:41.491
I'm sure all of yours look so cool.

00:05:42.458 --> 00:05:44.660
I’ll be excited to see it again.

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:49.615
Clicking on your option,
 going to your company

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:51.050
profile,

00:05:51.417 --> 00:05:54.370
the future of your company.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.339
Use hover states.

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:02.028
Just try it out and clickable buttons. Yay.
